/*
 * The free memory pool consists of a collection of contiguous blocks.
 * Each block has an integer at the beginning of it which specifies the
 * size of the block.  If the block is allocated, the integer contains
 * the negative of the size.  After the last block comes an integer with
 * a value of zero.
 *
 * To allocate a block, we want to scan the list of blocks starting with
 * the first block, merging adjacent free blocks, until we get a free
 * block which is large enough.  The actual implementation uses some
 * hacks to decrease the amount of scanning required.  Startfree always
 * points to the first free block or a block before it.  This keeps us
 * from repeatedly scanning allocated block at the start of the memory
 * pool.  In a similar vein, startbig points to what we believe is the
 * first free block whose size is >= BIG or a block before it.  Startbig
 * can actually point to some location after the first large free if the
 * first large free block was formed by freeing several small blocks
 * which have not yet been merged into a single free block.  To make this
 * less likely, the free routine will merge a freed block with any free
 * blocks after it, but the free routine cannot merge a freed block with
 * free blocks which precede it because there is no (efficient) way for
 * free to locate the preceding block.
 *
 * The variables lastsize and lastloc are used to implement one final
 * method to cut down on scanning.  When a malloc is performed, the
 * variable lastsize is set to the size of the largest block skipped
 * during the scan, and the variable lastloc is set to the end of the
 * scan.  The next call to malloc can start where the preceding one left
 * off if the number of bytes reqested is larger than the size of any
 * blocks skipped on the preceding malloc.  When a block is freed with a
 * lower address than lastloc, free assumes that the block is adjacent to
 * the largest free block skipped by malloc, and updates lastsize
 * accordingly.  This is necessary to ensure that starting at lastloc
 * will never cause a block that could be allocated to be skipped; a more
 * aggressive policy could be used.
 */

/*
 * Machine dependent stuff:
 *
 * PAGE_SIZE is the size of a page.  Malloc will try to keep the break
 * location on a page boundary to avoid wasting space (since the operating
 * system presumably has to allocate a whole page even if we only request
 * part of one).  PAGE_SIZE must be a power of 2.
 *
 * Head_t is a signed integer type that is capable of holding a value one
 * less than the maximum size of the pool.  Type int works fine on a VAX
 * because on a VAX processes only get 31 bits of address space.  In
 * practice most other 32 bit machines aren't going to allow processes to
 * allocate more that 2 gigabytes either.
 *
 * Machines generally have alignment restrictions which malloc must
 * obey.  ALIGN(n) returns the value of n rounded up to the minimum
 * value that malloc must allocate to keep things aligned.
 *
 * The code here assumes a linear address space, with sbrk allocating
 * successively higher addresses.
